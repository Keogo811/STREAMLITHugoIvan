Greetings teacher.
This dashboard shows information about the Iris flower dataset.

How to do use this app:
-First please activate the environment which comes together or else you have to manually download the modules in your own device. The manual command for your own environement or device is "pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn"

-The command into your terminal in the path of this project folder is "myenv\Scripts\activate"

-Then after, still in your terminal, run this command "streamlit run app.py"

The loading for the first time can be a bit long, do not worry.
You can now test and interact with the streamlit dashboard.
Thank you for testing this class project exercise on Streamlit.
